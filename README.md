# Omnicalc Bootstrap

## Setup

Follow the usual setup steps:

 1. Ensure that you've forked this repository to your own GitHub account. So, you should have a copy at `https://github.com/[YOUR USERNAME]/omnicalc-bs4`.
 1. Follow the [Starting on a project with Cloud9](https://guides.firstdraft.com/getting-started-with-cloud9.html) guide to set up your workspace.
 1. I always recommend closing as many browsers tabs as possible from the last project you were working on â€” it's very easy to get confused with too many tabs going.
 1. At a Terminal prompt, set up the project (install a bunch of powerful libraries on the workspace, whatever the project depends upon, etc):

    ```
    bin/setup
    ```

 1. Once the previous step completes successfully and you're back at the `$` prompt, launch your Rails application server by clicking the "Run Project" button at the top of the IDE. You'll know it launched when it says "Press Ctrl-C to stop".
 1. Visit the live application preview URL that it gives you to see the app running.
 1. As you work, remember to navigate to `/git` and **commit often as you work.**
 1. Make new branches freely to experiment! _Especially_ before starting on a new task.
